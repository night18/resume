    <b> About Me </b>
  </p>
  I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by <a href="http://mingyin.org/">Dr. Ming Yin</a>. My current research involves the areas of <b> human-AI interaction</b>, <b>applied machine learning</b>, and <b>the bias in machine learning systems</b>. I used experimental approaches to examine how to better design AI systems that people can trust and engage with effectively, and how to improve crowd workers' working environment through technology.

  Prior to Purdue, I worked in a technology company as an Android developer. I hold a Master of Computer Science from West Virginia University, and a Bachelor of Management in information Management from National Central University in Taiwan.
